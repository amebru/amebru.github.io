This is my CV as a website (CAAW 🐮). 

It is a plain vanilla website built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no frameworks, no build tools.

The CV is in `index.html`. CSS is in `css/styles.css` and JS is in `js/script.js`.

It's deployed here with github pages: http://ameliabruno.com/

Serve locally with `npx serve`.
